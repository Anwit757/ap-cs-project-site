      <p> Do you want to draw shapes online? This is a app / program that I coded on scratch that draws any shape you
        want. First, when you run the program, it will ask the user how many sides they want on their shapes, and after
        the user inputs their answer, the program will draw the shape. </p>

      <p>In this scratch project, I coded a program that allows you to do various math operations instantly. For
        example, one of the programs is that If you want to find the maximum of two numbers, you can just put it in the
        program and it will give you the biggest number. Another one is where if you have a list of numbers and you put
        it in the specific programs, it will give you either the maximum number of the list, the minimum number, the
        average number, or the sum of the numbers.

      <p>In this scratch project, we coded a character to make a short Mad Libs story. In this project, the program will
        first ask the user what to input as their name, skills, etc. And with the information the program is going to
        create a short story.

      <p> This is my fall genius hour. I did Python CMU and made images with the code I learned. I was able to make my
